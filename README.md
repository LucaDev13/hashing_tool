This program works with hashlib library. It can be useful to check the accuracy of a hash without having to use online
resources where there might be privacy or security concerns. 

It currently support the following algorithms: sha1, sha224, sha256, sha512, md5, sha3_224 but can easily be adapted 
to support any hashing algorithm that hashlib supports.
      
In order to use this program:

* `cd`into `hashing` folder
* run `python hash_text.py`
* choose an algorithm from the above list 
* insert the string to be hashed with the chosen algorithm.
* when done press q + Enter to stop the program
